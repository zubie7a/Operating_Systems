## Operating Systems Course Labs
This repo contains code from labs, homework, and other neat stuff from the Operating Systems class, done mostly in **C++**. This was made for educational purposes and is licensed under the **MIT License**.
### Labs
Labs for the Operating Systems Course, involving concepts such as threads, communication between processes, semaphores, monitors, and other neat stuff. For now I have included the first lab, which dealt with pipes and interprocess communication in **C++**.
### CPP
This is kind of a *Crash Course* in **C++**, presented by the [T.A.](https://github.com/ST0257/20141/tree/master/Lesson1-C%2B%2B/src), which I took the liberty of furthering a lot (and hoping for making a pull request soon) in code, concepts and comments, hoping to go beyond the handed material to reinforce my **C++** knowledge and hoping for others to reinforce it too.
