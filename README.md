## Operating Systems
This repo contains code from labs, homework, and other stuff from the **Operating Systems** class, done in **C++**.

This was made for educational purposes and is licensed under the **MIT License**.

### Labs
Labs for the course, involving concepts such as **threads**, communication between **processes**, **semaphores**, **monitors**, and other neat stuff. For now I have included the first lab, which dealt with pipes and interprocess communication in **C++**.

### CPP
This is kind of a *Crash Course* in **C++**, with useful concepts and comments, hoping to go beyond the handed material to reinforce my **C++** knowledge and hoping for others to reinforce it too.
