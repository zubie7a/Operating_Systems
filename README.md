##Operating Systems Course Labs
Labs for the Operating Systems Course, involving concepts such as threads, communication between processes, semaphores, monitors, and other neat stuff. For now I have included the first lab, which dealt with pipes and interprocess communication in **C++**. This was made for educational purposes and is licensed under the **MIT License**.
